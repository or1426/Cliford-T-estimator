Clifford+T estimator - estimate a single probability of an n qubit quantum circuit consisting of Clifford gates, T gates and a w qubit computational basis measurement at the end.

**Only tested in Python 3.8.1**

Components
1. Phase sensitive Clifford simulator - implementation of https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00128 section 4.1
2. Aaranson-Gottesman simulator - implementation of https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196
3. A lot of extra stuff
